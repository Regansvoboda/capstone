                <p>Along with the Hammerhead shark this breed also prefers temperate tropical waters, with the exception of the mediterranean sea.

                <p>Great White Sharks are the largest predatory fish on Earth and are found in cool, coastal waters around the world.

                <p>Whale sharks are actually sharks, which means they are fish—not mammals. They can also grow up to 40 feet long and weigh up to 20,000 pounds. At this size it makes them the largest fish in the sea. Each whale shark has distinctly individual markings, just like a human fingerprint. This proves handy for researchers identifying specific individuals and tracking their behavior around the Gulf.</p>

                <p>Green sea turtles are unique—they are one of the largest species of turtle, they can weigh up to 700 pounds! Like humans, green sea turtles breathe oxygen; however, they can also spend up to 2 hours underwater before needing to come to the surface for air. Unfortunately, these are an endangered species.</p>

                <p>Olive Ridley Turtles live in warm waters in the south Atlantic Ocean and Indo-Pacific Ocean, but sometimes one can be found along the coast. These turtles are relatively small. They can grow up to 2.5 feet and weigh about 100 pounds. Olive ridleys are small in size, but great in numbers—they are considered the most abundant of all the sea turtles.</p>

                <p>Dolphins live in the worlds seas and oceans and in some rivers too. Some dolphin species prefer to live in coastal areas, others like shallow water but prefer to live away from the coast close to patches of shallower water which are located further out to sea. Dolphins have adapted to live their whole lives in the water but they are mammals so they need to visit the surface to breathe air regularly.</p>

                <p>Pilot whales were given that name because pods were believed to be piloted by a leader. Pilot whales are among the largest of the oceanic dolphins, exceeded in size only by the orca. They and other large members of the dolphin family are also known as blackfish. They are highly social and may remain with their birth pod throughout their lifetime. Pilot whales are notorious for stranding themselves on beaches, but the reason behind this is not fully understood.</p>
