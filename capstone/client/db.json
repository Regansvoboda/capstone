            "about": "Dolphins live in the worlds seas and oceans and in some rivers too. Some dolphin species prefer to live in coastal areas, others like shallow water but prefer to live away from the coast close to patches of shallower water which are located further out to sea. Dolphins have adapted to live their whole lives in the water but they are mammals so they need to visit the surface to breathe air regularly."

They are highly social and may remain with their birth pod throughout their lifetime. Pilot whales are notorious for stranding themselves on beaches, but the reason behind this is not fully understood."
